# REST API Project with Node.js, MongoDB, and Express

## Description

This is a REST API project built using Node.js, MongoDB, and Express. The API allows you to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a collection of resources. It's a simple and scalable solution for building web-based applications with a database backend.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new resources to the database.
- **Read**: Retrieve resource data from the database.
- **Update**: Modify existing resource data.
- **Delete**: Remove resources from the database.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js: Install Node.js on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- MongoDB: Install MongoDB locally or use a cloud-based MongoDB service.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rest-api-nodejs-mongodb.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd rest-api-nodejs-mongodb
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

1. Update the `config.js` file with your MongoDB connection details.

## Usage

1. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Use an API client (e.g., Postman, cURL) to interact with the endpoints.

## API Endpoints

- **GET** `/api/resources`: Retrieve all resources.
- **GET** `/api/resources/:id`: Retrieve a specific resource by ID.
- **POST** `/api/resources`: Create a new resource.
- **PUT** `/api/resources/:id`: Update an existing resource by ID.
- **DELETE** `/api/resources/:id`: Delete a resource by ID.
